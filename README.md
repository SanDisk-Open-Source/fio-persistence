# fio-persistence
fio-persistence writes and trims a block device with generated data for a specified amount of time.  In its secondary verification mode, fio-persistence regenerates the data initially written to the device and reads the logical block addresses, comparing expected data to read data. It will also verify addresses not populated, if desired.  fio-persistence ensures the block device stored the expected data at the correct logical block addresses, and it will report any identified mismatches. It is useful in testing trim operations, as well as data persistence across reboots and power loss.
